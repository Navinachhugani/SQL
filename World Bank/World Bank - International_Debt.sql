-- the data is for international debt of all countries of the world, collected form the World Bank
-- The questions to answer here are as follows:
-- 1. What is the total amount of debt owed by all the countries?
-- 2. Which country owes the maximum amount of debt and how much is it?
-- 3. Whats the average amount of debt is owed by countries across different debt indicators?

-- Finding the distinct number of countries on the data
